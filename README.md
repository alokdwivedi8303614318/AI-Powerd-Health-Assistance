# 🚀 HealthCare Chatbot [AI]

HealthCare ChatBot is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to engage in meaningful conversations and provide assistance based on the intents it has been trained on. It has been trained using a deep learning model with the help of Google Colab. The model files include chatbot_model.h5, intents.json, classes.pkl, and words.pkl.

## Key Features: 👨‍💻

- ### Intent Recognition:

  The bot utilizes intents.json to recognize and categorize user queries into specific intents such as greetings, inquiries about services, or requests for information.

- ### Deep Learning Model:

  Trained on a neural network using chatbot_model.h5, the bot has learned to map user input to appropriate responses based on the training data.

- ### User Interaction:

  The chatbot is integrated into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed in chatgui.py, providing users with a user-friendly interface to interact with the bot.

- ### Contextual Responses:

  It aims to provide relevant and contextually appropriate responses based on the conversation flow and the intent of the user's queries.

- ### Scalability:
  The bot's architecture allows for further training and expansion of its knowledge base to handle a wider range of intents and user queries.

## 🛠 How It Works

When a user interacts with the GUI interface (chatgui.py), their input is processed by the deep learning model (chatbot_model.h5). The model uses the training data stored in intents.json, classes.pkl, and words.pkl to recognize the intent behind the input and generate an appropriate response.

## 🚀 Future Development

Future iterations of ChatBot 9000 could involve enhancements in natural language understanding, integration with external APIs for real-time information retrieval, and continuous learning to improve its accuracy and breadth of knowledge.
